Follow the Leopard instruction to line 191, the dtbs patch. Instead of applying that patch, there are two separate DTS repos that need to be patched.

cd Linux_for_Tegra_tx2/sources/hardware/nvidia/platform/t18x/quill
git apply leopard.single.quill.patch
Linux_for_Tegra_tx2/sources/hardware/nvidia/platform/t18x/common
git apply leopard.single.common.patch

At this point, resume following the Leopard instructions.
